# MudPy
A Python wrapper of Triumf's [MUD](https://cmms.triumf.ca/mud/) library.

Somewhat hilariously, this package's functionality already existed (created in 2020) more or less and I would highly recommend theirs and won't be further developing this one. See the (originaly apparently?) [MudPy](https://github.com/dfujim/mudpy).
